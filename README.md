# Extract & Analyze YouTube Data using YouTube API and Python
I'm going to be working with the Youtube API to Scrape YouTube data using Python . I build a Python Project to collect videos statistics from multiple channels using the googleapiclient python library to make an API call and save it as a pandas dataframe. Working with APIs is a necessary skillset for all data scientists and should be incorporated into your data science projects. 

Iâ€™ll start with the first step and learn how to work with APIs in python to collect our data.

### Steps to follow :
1. Create YouTube API Key to access youtube Data
2. Choose the channels you'd like to analyze their data
3. Get all the videos with some general and basic information 
4. Get in depth statistics for each video 
5. Gererate graphs and Visualize the data

### To create your YouTube API Key
1. Go to the API Console.
2. From the projects list, select a project or create a new one.
3. If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the left side menu and select APIs & services.
4. On the left, choose Credentials.
5. Click Create credentials and then select API key.
